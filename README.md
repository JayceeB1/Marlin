ONLY CHOOSE BUGFIX BRANCH!!!!!

Last Build with TMC V0.7 stepper drivers

As I'm using TMC5160 v1.2 & TMC2209 v3.0 you'll maybe have to change some settings

I've also made some modifications to the pins files to use filament dectector (not enabled yet) and Z Max endstop

enjoy

If you found this usefull, you can buy me a beer ;)
